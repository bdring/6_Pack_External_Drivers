# 6 Pack_External Driver CNC Controller

This CNC controller is based on the 6 Pack, but this one is optimized for external stepper motor drivers. This is less flexible than the regular 6 Pack, but it has a few advantages if you only need to use external drivers.

- Smaller footprint
- No jumpers to set.
- Outputs 5V signals with enough current to driver the optically isolated inputs most driver use.
- Fully compatible with all the CNC I/O module of a 6 Pack.
